# About Me
I love computers and solving problems.  
I specialise in solving complex problems that require diving deep into the problem space and attempting to figure out the solution that meets as many objectives as possible.

I am a highly skilled software engineer with more than 11 years in professional software design, development and integration.  
I have used the last few years to hone my ability to write error resistant code which can be easily monitored, maintained and configured.

Due to my first job at Thales I have a soft spot for real time programming where time and memory efficiency are critical.  
Designing very specialised systems with a limited problem space is ideal to my way of thinking, and coming up with clever ways to maximise performance and reliability feels really good.

On top of that Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to be the first security engineer in Campaign Monitors security team, working from the ground up to implement security checks and systems to secure the application, infrastructure, internal tooling and supply chain from malicious actors.
